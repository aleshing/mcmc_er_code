# mcmc_er_code

This repository contains code used to reproduce the illustrative example in the manuscript "Convergence Diagnostics for Entity Resolution" by Serge Aleshin-Guendel and Rebecca C. Steorts. The structure of this repository is as follows:

- helper_functions.R contains functions used in the illustrative example. Namely functions to initialize a partition and generate data structures to plot the effective sample size over time for parameters of interest.
- illustrative_example.R is a script used to reproduce the results from the illustrative example in Section 5 of the manucript, including all tables and plots.
- illustrative_example_extra.R is a script used to reproduce the extra results from the illustrative example in Appendix B of the manucript, including all tables and plots.
